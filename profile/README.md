## Welcome there

TurboBuild is a build acceleration tool.  
It can significantly reduce compilation time, at least by more than half.   
Doesn't require you to do anything, just a config file. It works just fine.  
If you work on windows, use mscv. It's the only free tool that can do it.  

## How to use


## Cloud process technology
The local process can run on any accessible device, just as it would run locally. 
The result of the execution is exactly the same as that of the local execution.
Based on this technology. The compilation process can be moved to any device within the cluster.
Therefore, as long as the number of CPU cores in the cluster is sufficiently large, the number of concurrent compilations can approach the limit. and the compilation time can approach the minimum.
